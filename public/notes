EJS:
-This templating engine is used to give a feel that app loads faster.
-When the base url was requested, we create a client store object from server store object
-We also fetch the static pages and their route paths from server to client
-We then render this initial data along with static mark up to the client in index.EJS
-Even the javascript is disabled on the browser, the static HTML markups and data of the application gets rendered
